The app uses a task radio group which uses radio buttons whivh allow for a user to either pick install door, build shelf, and assemble furniture. The app also uses checkboxes with different items which would allow the user to pick from the three different choices aswell as a text view for the user to enter the amount of hours that would be required. The last function would be for the button which would allow an individual to make the calculation to recieve a total and this function on the MainActivity.kt page would be the calculateTotal function.
